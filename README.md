Lambda function to fetch and send betting odds data to Discord

# Sports Odds Data Automation with AWS and Discord Integration

Overview
This project automates the process of fetching sports betting odds data, storing it in AWS S3, and sending 
notifications with presigned URLs to a Discord channel. It provides real-time updates on sports odds for
basketball (NBA, NCAAB) and football (NFL, NCAAF) directly on a Discord channel. This project leverages AWS Lambda for 
serverless architecture, The Odds API for sports data, and Discord webhooks for notifications.
